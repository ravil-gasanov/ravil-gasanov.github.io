### About me

I am a Computer Science major currently working on my Master Thesis at [Exploratory Data Analysis group](https://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/people/), [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). Specifically, I am developing a causal discovery method that does not assume away hidden confounders and uniquely identifies the causal relationships using the Minimum Description Length principle.

Key interests: machine learning, software engineering, statistics, exploratory data analysis, data storytelling.

Broader interests: writing, recreational robotics, business, investment, human intelligence, operations research, information theory.

I am looking for a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer internship. Open to relocation (EEA, Canada, UK, and US).

### Content:

1. Articles on data science, software engineering, productivity, etc.

2. HOWTO: practical guides

3. Selected personal projects

4. *War stories* putting valuable lessons in real life context.
