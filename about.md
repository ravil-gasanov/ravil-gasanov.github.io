**Primer Notes** is a blog, where I strive to share **useful knowledge** and **cautionary tales**.

More specifically, types of posts you may expect include:

1. Notes and summaries for technical textbooks and coursework. Subjects: computer science, software engineering, machine learning, statistics, etc.

2. Concrete organizational systems and actionable advice to improve productivity.

3. "War Stories" illustrating valuable lessons in a real-life context. 

4. Occasionally, my thoughts on trending topics.
