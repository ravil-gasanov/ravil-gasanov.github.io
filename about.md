## Experience
I have recently broken into the fintech industry by joining Prime Compliance Limited. I am responsible for data engineering, business process automation, and financial data analysis.

## Education and Academic Experience

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from Saarland University, one of Germany's leading institutions. My studies have primarily focused on statistics, machine learning, and software engineering.

I gained a year of research experience through the thesis project at [Exploratory Data Analysis group](https://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/people/), [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). There I developed a causal discovery algorithm that does not assume causal sufficiency, i.e., that we have measured all relevant variables.

I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant for "Statistics with R" class.
