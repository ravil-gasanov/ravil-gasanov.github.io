### About me

I am a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science from Saarland University. I conducted my thesis project at [Exploratory Data Analysis group](https://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/people/), [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). There I developed a causal discovery algorithm that does not assume causal sufficiency, i.e., that we have measured all relevant variables.

Professional interests: machine learning, exploratory data analysis, data storytelling, software engineering.

Broader interests: writing, business, investment, weightlifting, boxing.

### Content:

1. Study notes on data science, software engineering, productivity, etc.

2. HOWTO: practical guides

3. PROJECT: personal projects

4. *War stories* putting valuable lessons in real life context.
