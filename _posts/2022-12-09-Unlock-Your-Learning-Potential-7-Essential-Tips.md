title: 'Unlock Your Learning Potential: 7 Essential Tips'
---

## 1. Use It or Lose It
The best way to ensure that you are retaining what you are learning is to use it. If you don't use the knowledge and skills you acquire, they will gradually fade.

So whenever you are setting a specific learning goal, think about how you will integrate that knowledge and skill into your processes.

## 2. Process vs Product
However, when you are studying, it is important to focus on the process and not just the end product. 

Study out of curiosity. This will help you avoid burning out and enjoy the learning experience.

## 3. Binging be damned
It is better to study for shorter periods every day, rather than trying to cram all your studying into one long session once a week.

This way your brain gets the chance to process the information and connect the dots.

Finally, spaced repetition has been shown to improve retention.

## 4. A note on notes
Do not go around mindlessly highlighting or copy-pasting notes.

Instead, complete a section and jot down the most important bits in your own words. Then iteratively improve the notes and their organization as you cover more ground and deepen your understanding.

Handwritten notes may help you to implement the above tips. You can transfer the notes into a digital format when they are more refined and perhaps turn them into a blog post.

Finally, it is better to try and recall the material, rather than just review your notes. This requires more effort, but this way you will strengthen the neural connections that make the knowledge.

## 5. Abstract
Working with complex systems, software engineers quickly learn to appreciate the power of abstractions. 

Indeed, there is only so much detail a human being can hold in their mind when reasoning. Therefore, it is extremely useful to break up whatever you are learning into layers of abstractions.

More complex concepts should be higher in the abstraction hierarchy, and constructed in a way that allows you to use them by recalling as few of the inner working details as possible.

For example, you do not need to remember the formal underpinnings of integer numbers to perform basic arithmetic.

## 6. Understanding vs Mastery

It is also important to remember that understanding something is not the same as being able to do it yourself, and it certainly doesn't mean you have mastered the subject. 

So don't stop at understanding. Deliberate practice is key. Lots of it.

## 7. The Puzzled and the Golden Hammer 
How many times have you left a class clueless when or where to apply what you have just learned? Or, alternatively, every problem started to look like a nail for your new Golden Hammer?

Research the popular use cases for the topic you are studying to get a sense of when and where you can use it.
