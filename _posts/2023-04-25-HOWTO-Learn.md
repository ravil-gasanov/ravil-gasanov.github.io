Learning is perhaps the most important aspect of intelligence. Surprisingly, most people do not know how to learn effectively.

We can improve our learning ability by using scientifically backed approaches. However, it is important to remember that we are not the *average subject*. We should understand the fundamentals behind learning, start with techniques that work on average and then experiment with what works for us as an individual. 

Moreover, we should aim to be practical rather than optimal. If we can sustain a reasonably effective learning strategy, there is typically no need to push for the last 5% at the risk of burn out. In other words, we should factor in how much we enjoy a particular style of learning.

# Fundamentals
In this section we will cover the fundamentals of learning and a few lifestyle tips that will boost our brain health. In particular, we will talk about different mental states that help with learning, discuss procrastination, memory, as well as the importance of sleep, diet and exercise.

## Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

There are two primary brain modes, focused and diffuse, that we alternate to learn effectively.

First, we focus on the material. After we have thoroughly familiarized ourselves with the topic, we can make use of the diffuse mode of thinking. 

In diffuse mode, we let our brains wander, rather than focus on anything specific. The free flow of information allows our brain to think more creatively and make new connections. This deepens our understanding of the material and improves retention. This is backed by research, and there is also a lot of anecdotal evidence, where scientists get their *aha* moments during routine activities, like taking a walk.

## Chunking
A chunk is a unit of information that we consolidate through repeated exposure or practice. It is a neural pathway that encodes an idea or an action.

There are three key steps in creating a useful chunk.

1. We focus on the raw information.
2. We understand the main idea, by switching between focused and diffuse modes of thinking if necessary.
3. Finally, we put the new information in context, so we know when to use it.

Chunks are our building blocks for knowledge and skills. A large library of useful chunks can help us to make new connections and give us insight for innovation.

Chunks can get more complex. For example, suppose we learned how to throw hooks and uppercuts. We could now combine these two movements into a *right hook - right uppercut* combination Tyson style. After enough practice this will become a single chunk, different from separately executing a hook and an uppercut.

## Practice Makes Permanent
Contrary to the popular saying, *only* perfect practice makes perfect. Practice makes permanent. Relatedly, we are often advised deliberate practice. But what is deliberate practice exactly? We will answer this question in two parts.

First, we should learn not to fool ourselves. By frequently conducting mini-tests or recall sessions, we can identify gaps and fix errors in our knowledge.

Second, we should avoid practicing only the easy parts. Instead, practice the difficult parts until they become easy as well.

Deliberate practice can also help us to fight Einstellung. The German word that means mindset, describes a phenomenon when existing habits and established neural patterns prevent us from finding a better idea. This is also why in addition to exploiting our current knowledge, we should strive to explore uncharted territory keeping an open mind.

## Procrastination

### Switching
Procrastination often hits when we stop focusing on the current task, either because we finished it
or got frustrated. This is the moment to strategically apply willpower and focus on the next
task without getting distracted. It is much easier to stay on the productive track, once we get started.

### Task Aversion
Sometimes a task is unclear, ambiguous or overwhelming. To deal with task aversion, we can use the *ABC* strategies.

- **Audit**. Review relevant details to improve understanding.
- **Break**. Create a plan of action by breaking up the task into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Clarify**. Seek clarification or guidance. Unclear tasks are often set by other people.

# Learning: Strategies and Tactics

## 1. Use It or Lose It
The best way to ensure that you are retaining what you are learning is to use it. If you don't use the knowledge and skills you acquire, they will gradually fade.

So whenever you are setting a specific learning goal, think about how you will integrate that knowledge and skill into your processes.

## 2. Process vs Product
However, when you are studying, it is important to focus on the process and not just the end product.

Study out of curiosity. This will help you avoid burning out and enjoy the learning experience.

## 3. Binging be damned
It is better to study for shorter periods every day, rather than trying to cram all your studying into one long session once a week.

This way your brain gets the chance to process the information and connect the dots.

Finally, spaced repetition has been shown to improve retention.

## 4. A note on notes
Do not go around mindlessly highlighting or copy-pasting notes.

Instead, complete a section and jot down the most important bits in your own words. Then iteratively improve the notes and their organization as you cover more ground and deepen your understanding.

Handwritten notes may help you to implement the above tips. You can transfer the notes into a digital format when they are more refined and perhaps turn them into a blog post.

Finally, it is better to try and recall the material, rather than just review your notes. This requires more effort, but this way you will strengthen the neural connections that make the knowledge.

## 5. Abstract
Working with complex systems, software engineers quickly learn to appreciate the power of abstractions. 

Indeed, there is only so much detail a human being can hold in their mind when reasoning. Therefore, it is extremely useful to break up whatever you are learning into layers of abstractions.

More complex concepts should be higher in the abstraction hierarchy, and constructed in a way that allows you to use them by recalling as few of the inner working details as possible.

For example, you do not need to remember the formal underpinnings of integer numbers to perform basic arithmetic.

## 6. Understanding vs Mastery

It is also important to remember that understanding something is not the same as being able to do it yourself, and it certainly doesn't mean you have mastered the subject. 

So don't stop at understanding. Deliberate practice is key. Lots of it.

## 7. The Puzzled and the Golden Hammer 
How many times have you left a class clueless when or where to apply what you have just learned? Or, alternatively, every problem started to look like a nail for your new Golden Hammer?

Research the popular use cases for the topic you are studying to get a sense of when and where you can use it.

## 8. Feedback
Improvement in certain skills, like writing, becomes increasingly difficult. In such cases, feedback from a proficient individual is invaluable. 

Feedback is often concrete, so we should learn to recognize patterns and construct rules given instances.

## 9. Teach it
A good way to improve our understanding even further is to teach. This helps in several ways. 

First, by exploring the best ways to explain the material, we distill and structure our own knowledge. 

Furthermore, we are motivated to critically reflect and triple-check everything.

Finally, the questions and feedback from students can highlight important gaps or bring new perspective.
