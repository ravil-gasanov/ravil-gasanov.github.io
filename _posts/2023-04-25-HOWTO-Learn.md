title: 'HOWTO: Learn'

Learning is perhaps the most important aspect of intelligence. Surprisingly, most people do not know how to learn effectively.

We can improve our learning ability by using scientifically backed approaches. But science speaks to the *average subject*, and to none of us in particular. We should understand the fundamentals behind learning, start with general recommendations and experiment to find what works for *us*.

It is also better to be practical rather than optimal. If we can sustain a reasonably effective learning strategy, there is no need to push for the last 5%, risking burnout. In other words, whether we enjoy a given style of learning is an important factor.

# Fundamentals
In this section, we cover the fundamentals of effective learning. We discuss important mental states, learning processes, procrastination, and health.

## Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

There are two primary learning modes - focused and diffuse.

First, we focus on the information. The goal is to learn the facts and identify key takeaways. The pieces do not have to form a perfect picture yet, or provide deep insight, but we should become closely familiar with the material.

After a focused session, it is useful to enter the diffuse mode. That is, we let our brains wander, rather than focus on anything specific. The free flow of information in this state allows our brains to make new connections and, as a result, think more creatively. We can deepen our understanding, improve retention and break through when we are stuck. The importance of diffuse thinking is backed by research, and there are famous examples of scientists getting *aha* moments, when taking a walk or a bath.

The two modes are used in alternation. Most of the study session (~80%) should be spent in focused mode, since as fun as diffuse mode can be - we simply cannot afford to reinvent all of knowledge or delve deeply into every idea.

## Chunking
A chunk is a unit of information that we consolidate through repeated exposure and practice. It is a neural pathway that encodes an idea or an action.

There are three key steps in creating a useful chunk.

1. We focus on the raw information.
2. We understand the main idea, by switching between focused and diffuse modes of thinking if necessary.
3. Finally, we put the new information in context, so we know when to use it.

Chunks are our building blocks for knowledge and skills. A large library of useful chunks can help us to make new connections and give us insight for innovation.

Chunks can get more complex. For example, suppose we learned how to throw hooks and uppercuts. We could now combine these two movements into a *right hook - right uppercut* combination Tyson style. After enough practice this will become a single chunk, different from separately executing a hook and an uppercut.

## Practice Makes Permanent
Contrary to the popular saying, *only* perfect practice makes perfect. Practice makes permanent. Relatedly, we are often advised deliberate practice. But what is deliberate practice exactly? We will answer this question in two parts.

First, we should learn not to fool ourselves. By frequently conducting mini-tests or recall sessions, we can identify gaps and fix errors in our knowledge.

Second, we should avoid practicing only the easy parts. Instead, practice the difficult parts until they become easy as well.

Deliberate practice can also help us fight Einstellung. The German word that means mindset, describes a phenomenon when existing habits and established neural patterns prevent us from finding a better idea. This is also why in addition to exploiting our current knowledge, we should strive to explore uncharted territory keeping an open mind.

## Procrastination

### Switching
Procrastination often hits when we stop focusing on the current task, either because we finished it
or got frustrated. This is the moment to strategically apply willpower and focus on the next
task without getting distracted. It is much easier to stay on the productive track, once we get started.

### Task Aversion
Sometimes a task is unclear, ambiguous or overwhelming. To deal with task aversion, we can use the *ABC* strategies.

- **Audit**. Review relevant details to improve understanding.
- **Break**. Create a plan of action by breaking up the task into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Clarify**. Seek clarification or guidance. Unclear tasks are often set by other people.


## Sleep, Exercise and Diet
There are multi-billion industries that sell supplements to boost brain health and make us smarter. Most of them do not have any scientific foundation. The most effective brain *drugs* are proper sleep, regular exercise, and a healthy diet.

Get eight hours of undisturbed sleep. A dark and cool (but not cold) room can improve sleep.

Regular exercise improves general health, mood, and the rate of neurogenesis (new brain cells). There is a wide range of choices, like running or weightlifting.

Nutrition is highly individual and depends on our primary goals. The general advice we can give is to avoid extremes and stick to a sustainable diet. We should also identify foods that have a bad effect on us (for example, we feel sluggish after eating potato chips) and avoid them.

## Experiments
To figure out what works best for us, we keep performance records and then compare results between two competing approaches.

For example, we could study only in the morning the first month, and only in the evening the second month. Then using our records (e.g., number of chapters, topic difficulty, etc.), we could compare our performance and make an informed decision on the best time of day.

# Learning: Tips and Tricks

## 1. Use It or Lose It
The best way to retain the knowledge and skills we acquire is to use them. The best way to ensure we will use them is to set relevant learning goals.

## 2. Process vs Product
It is important to focus on the process and not just the end product.

Study out of curiosity. Enjoy the learning experience.

## 3. Binging be damned
It is better to consistently study for shorter periods, rather than procrastinate and then cram everything into one long session at the end of the deadline.

As we have discussed, this way our brain gets the chance to process the information and connect the dots.

Finally, spaced repetition has been shown to improve retention.

## 4. A note on notes
No mindless highlighting or copy-pasting notes.

Instead, we complete a section and then jot down the most important bits in our own words. Then iteratively improve the notes and their organization.

Handwritten notes are best. They will encourage us to be concise and clear. We can transfer the notes into a digital format when they are more refined and perhaps turn them into a blog post.

Finally, it is better to recall the material, rather than just review our notes. This requires more effort, but this way we will strengthen the neural connections that make the knowledge.

## 5. Abstract
Working with complex systems, software engineers quickly learned to appreciate the power of abstractions. 

Abstracting complex concepts allows to quickly access the key ideas without recalling all the tedious details.

For example, you do not need to know or remember the formal definitions of integer numbers to perform basic arithmetic.

## 6. Understanding vs Mastery

Understanding something is not the same as being able to do it. And it certainly does not imply mastery.

So to achieve mastery, we do not stop at understanding. Deliberate practice is key. Lots of it.

## 7. The Puzzled and the Golden Hammer 
We should always learn the context where our new knowledge or skill are applicable. Otherwise, we risk to either be unable to use it or use it inappropriately.

## 8. Feedback
Improvement in certain skills, like writing, becomes increasingly difficult. In such cases, feedback from a proficient individual is invaluable. 

Feedback is often concrete, so we should learn to recognize patterns and construct rules given instances.

## 9. Teach it
A good way to improve our understanding even further is to teach. This helps in several ways. 

First, by exploring the best ways to explain the material, we distill and structure our own knowledge. 

Furthermore, we are motivated to critically reflect and triple-check everything.

Finally, questions and feedback from students can highlight important gaps or bring new perspective.
